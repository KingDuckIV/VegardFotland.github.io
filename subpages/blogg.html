            <h2>My thoughts about the New Media Writing Prize</h2>
            <p>What Remains? was my first ever digital artwork, and my bachelors project at that, and to have it shortlisted among the many wonderful works across the globe was an honour and a half. It doesn’t feel real. Its so distant. And though I am eternally grateful to the judges who chose to shortlist me, the biggest honour was seeing how proud my teachers became on my behalf. Alinta Krauth who was my supervisor on the project and Jason Nelson who helped and supported me along the way. <br> It is similar to music in a way. I have played many concerts throughout the years, and its always great to hear from the people who liked it, but nothing ever compares to when a musician you respect and look up to comes over and nods in agreement and compliments you. It’s a special type of bubbly fuzziness. <br>
            So, thank you to the wonderful people at the New Media Writing Prize! Huzzah! </p>
